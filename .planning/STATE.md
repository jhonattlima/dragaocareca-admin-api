# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-28)

**Core value:** Serve the public frontend with stable backend-owned data contracts so page rendering no longer depends on legacy PHP responses or client-side reconstruction rules.
**Current focus:** Phase 12 — Secure Episode Artifact Downloads

## Current Position

Phase: 12 (Secure Episode Artifact Downloads) — EXECUTING
Plan: 3 of 4
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-07-28 — Phase 12 execution started

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Milestone v1.1]: Replace legacy PHP public responses with backend-owned JSON endpoints.
- [Milestone v1.1]: Keep public data split across distinct endpoints.
- [Milestone v1.1]: Rename public support terminology from `patreon` to `supporters`.
- [Milestone v1.2]: Keep summary generation transcript-only and sequential.
- [Milestone v1.2]: Store suggested summaries as draft artifacts beside the episode files.
- [Milestone v1.2]: Expose summary drafts through a protected backend read endpoint.
- [Post-v1.2]: Use Gemini as the current configured provider for transcript and summary generation; preserve internal/llama fallbacks.
- [Post-v1.2]: Use production-feed structure as a static summary style reference, never as factual generation context.
- [Phase ?]: Plan 12-02 may install archiver; @types/archiver remains conditional on TypeScript compiler evidence.
- [Phase ?]: Install only approved archiver; defer @types/archiver until a future import produces a compiler declaration error.
- [Phase ?]: Run artifact-download verification as a compiled development script before selector or preflight implementation.

### Pending Todos

- Discuss and plan Phase 12 with `$gsd-discuss-phase 12` or `$gsd-plan-phase 12`.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Milestone v1.1 was archived as an override closeout because Phases 6-8 did not retain their original GSD phase directories and summaries.
- Phase 5 runtime validation is now captured through `npm run verify:public-episodes`, which verifies the shipped route handler without relying on sandboxed localhost networking.

## Deferred Items

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| artifact | Missing original GSD phase directories/summaries for Phases 6-8 | acknowledged at milestone closeout | 2026-07-23 |
| verification | Milestone closeout used reconciled code/docs evidence for Phases 6-8 rather than preserved phase-level verification artifacts | acknowledged at milestone closeout | 2026-07-23 |
| feature | admin-web summary-field prefill | deferred to later frontend milestone | 2026-07-23 |
| technology | production transcription-provider evaluation (Gemini vs `whisper.cpp` / `faster-whisper`) | deferred tech debt | 2026-07-28 |

### TD-001: Validate the permanent transcription provider

The current development configuration uses `EPISODE_TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER=gemini`; `internal` keeps the local `whisper.cpp` path available as a fallback. Before making Gemini the permanent production default, compare quality, cost, quota, privacy, long-episode latency, and memory behavior on the 4 GB Hostinger VPS. Revisit when transcription becomes slow, unreliable, or cost-sensitive.
